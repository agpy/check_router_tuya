# check_router_tuya
Script is watching for the state of the ISP router (second in Multi-WAN) and reboot frozen router via smart socket connected to the Tuya cloud.
Given that I did not have access to control the router, I was forced to use the smart socket. 

Script uses tuyapy library (pip install tuyapy) - a Python library for Tuya Device with Python 3+.
